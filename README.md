# HRV-Metrics
A software tool for the analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

From the project's paper Abstract:
Over the years, many correlations were made between the autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This motivated the development of quantitative indicators of autonomic activity, such as measures of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which describes changes over time in the interval between consecutive heart beats. HRV is modulated by several physiological mechanisms, the main one being the balance between the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. HRV parameters aim at characterizing large amounts of ECG data in an effort to identify patterns and abnormalities with clinical significance. However, due to the complexity of HRV, a lack of significant clinical correlations exists for some of these measures. Additional clinical data and HRV research tools may help establish such correlations. The present work led to the development of a programme for the analysis of HRV (called HRV Metrics). For a given ECG record it reports back several types of parameters such as time- and frequency- domain metrics as well as nonlinear metrics.
